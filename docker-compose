To install Docker Compose on a Red Hat Linux machine, you can follow these steps:
1. Update the system:
sudo yum update

2. Install Docker (if it's not already installed):
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/ 

3. Start and enable the Docker service:
sudo systemctl start docker 
sudo systemctl enable docker 

4. Download the Docker Compose binary using curl:
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

5. Apply executable permissions to the Docker Compose binary:
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

6. Verify the installation by checking the version of Docker Compose:
docker-compose --version
                   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To list Docker Compose projects on your machine, you can use the following command:
docker-compose ps
  
This command will list all the running services of the Docker Compose projects on your machine. If you want to see all Docker Compose projects, including stopped ones, you can use:
docker-compose ps -a

If you're looking for the Docker Compose files themselves (the docker-compose.yml files), you can search for them in your filesystem. Typically, Docker Compose projects are organized in directories, and each directory contains a docker-compose.yml file defining the services for that project. You can use commands like find or locate to search for these files:
find / -name docker-compose.yml
Replace / with the directory where you suspect your Docker Compose files might be located if you want to limit the search scope.
